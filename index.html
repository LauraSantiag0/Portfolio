        <p>Hello! My name is Laura, and I am 30 years old. In addition to being passionate about technology, I am the mother of four wonderful children. My interest in technology began early, and over the years, my passion for learning and innovation has only grown. As a mother of four, I understand what it means to balance family life with school and career. Finding time to enhance my technology skills can be challenging, but it is a journey I am committed to. I believe that technology has the power to transform the world, and I want to play a role in that transformation.

            Currently, I am dedicating myself to my studies in the field of technology, striving to improve my knowledge in programming, web development, and other related areas. I see technology as a tool that can create opportunities and improve people's lives, and I am eager to be part of this ever-evolving world. In addition to my studies and responsibilities as a mother, I also enjoy [Insert hobbies or personal interests here]. I believe that a diversity of experiences enriches my perspective and makes me a more well-rounded professional.
            
            If you are interested in discussing projects, technology, or just exchanging ideas, please feel free to get in touch. I am always open to new connections and collaborations. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I am excited about what the future holds!

            <p>This was my first project, it was done using blocks, I didn't know how to write a single line of HTML yet, but I already had my first baby! Seeing this website finished was magical.</p>

          <a href="https://laurasantiagoto-dolist.netlify.app/" target="_blank">  <h3>Todo list</h3></a>
            <p>For this project, I developed a dynamic and responsive To-Do List application using React. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with a clean and intuitive user interface. Here are the key features of the To-Do List application:

                Task Management: Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks that are no longer needed.
                State Management: Utilizes React's state management to handle the dynamic updates of the task list.
                Component-Based Architecture: The application is structured using reusable React components, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.
                Form Handling: Includes forms for adding and editing tasks, with input validation to ensure data integrity.
                Local Storage: Implements local storage to persist tasks across browser sessions, so users don't lose their task list upon refreshing or closing the browser.
                Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, providing a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
                This project highlights my proficiency in React and my ability to build functional web applications that prioritize user experience and interactivity.</p>
